## Name of the Project
UrbanHub

## Violations list

### Prototype 1 - Desktop

1. **H2: Match between system and the real world**
   - *Where:* My Trips - Delete trip
   - *What:* Use of "Don’t Delete" for canceling deleting a whole trip; it should be something like “Cancel”
   - *Why:* Consider using plain language and simple, recognizable terms that align with users' common knowledge and mental models.
   - *Severity:* 3

2. **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - *Where:* My Trips - Clicking on previous trips
   - *What:* The action of clicking on previous trips within the "My Trips" section lacks consistency and adherence to standards, as it results in an unintended consequence.
   - *Why:* According to established design standards, clicking on a previous trip should typically lead to a view-only mode, allowing users to review the details without the risk of unintentional modifications. However, in this instance, it appears that the action may lead to unintended modifications, violating the principle of consistency and user expectations.
   - *Severity:* 3

3. **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - *Where:* Trip overview
   - *What:* Typically, users expect the back button in this position on other pages.
   - *Why:* Inconsistencies in design elements can lead to user confusion; maintaining a standard placement would enhance user experience.
   - *Severity:* 3

4. **H3: User control and freedom**
   - *Where:* Plan your next trip - How many people are going
   - *What:* The app lacks the option to include kids (0-17 y/o) when adjusting the number of people.
   - *Why:* Fails to address families as potential users.
   - *Severity:* 3

5. **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - *Where:* Plan your next trip
   - *What:* The absence of a home button on this page departs from the expected consistency, as typically, a home button is anticipated to be present at the top of every page.
   - *Why:* Ensuring a uniform presence of the home button across all pages is crucial for maintaining a consistent and predictable user experience.
   - *Severity:* 3

6. **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - *Where:* Trip Overview - Delete Attraction
   - *What:* The confirmation prompt for deleting an attraction is on the left side of the window, contrary to the common practice of having it on the right in web applications.
   - *Why:* Deviating from established norms in button placement could cause confusion for users accustomed to standard web application interactions.
   - *Severity:* 2

7. **H1: Visibility of system status**
   - *Where:* Trip overview - add attraction
   - *What:* The system should display a message indicating that the attraction has been added and an updated view of their trip overview.
   - *Why:* This information should be presented in a visual and accessible manner, such as a pop-up window for the user to make sure that the modification has been done.
   - *Severity:* 2

8. **H1: Visibility of system status**
   - *Where:* My trips
   - *What:* The system should display a message indicating that the trip has been deleted successfully by clicking on Delete.
   - *Why:* This information should be presented in a visual and accessible manner, such as a pop-up window for the user to make sure that the modification has been done.
   - *Severity:* 2

9. **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - *Where:* Plan your next trip - How many people are going
   - *What:* The platform permits users to adjust the number of people, but the placement of the + and - buttons is reversed from the conventional user expectation.
   - *Why:* Inverting the button order deviates from established design standards, potentially causing confusion for users.
   - *Severity:* 2

10. **H1: Visibility of system status**
    - *Where:* Trip overview - is there anything I can do for you
    - *What:* The system should display a message indicating that the Message sent successfully by clicking on send.
    - *Why:* This information should be presented in a visual and accessible manner, such as a pop-up window for the user to make sure that the modification has been done.
    - *Severity:* 2

11. **H2: Match between system and the real world**
    - *Where:* Plan your next trip - Heading
    - *What:* Instead of Plan your next trip as a heading, I prefer to use “Plan your trip”.
    - *Why:* It’s a current trip that the user is planning for not the next one.
    - *Severity:* 2

12. **H3: User control and freedom**
    - *Where:* Choose your destination
    - *What:* The app doesn’t have any “Cancel” to exit planning for a new trip.
    - *Why:* Clearly label and place "Cancel" buttons in the user interface, so the user quickly understands how to exit or return to a previous stage.
    - *Severity:* 2

13. **H3: User control and freedom**
    - *Where:* Plan your next trip - Which meals would you like to include
    - *What:* Limited meal options provided (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) without considering other possibilities like morning or afternoon caffe or snacks.
    - *Why:* Given the diverse culinary offerings in various cities, integrating additional options aligns with the platform's AI capabilities, accommodating user preferences more comprehensively.
    - *Severity:* 2

14. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* Trip Overview - Add Attraction
    - *What:* The confirmation for saving an attraction is on the usual right-side placement in web applications.
    - *Why:* Consistency in button placement aids user familiarity and deviating from this standard may lead to confusion.
    - *Severity:* 2

15. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
    - *Where:* Preferences
    - *What:* While the platform allows users to address "more questions" related to preferences, a more user-friendly approach would involve integrating all preference options directly in the initial preferences step.
    - *Why:* Placing preferences in a dedicated box during the first step would streamline the process, eliminating the need to navigate to "more questions" and respond to potentially unnecessary queries.
    - *Severity:* 2

16. **H5: Error prevention**
    - *Where:* Trip Overview - Add Attraction
    - *What:* The system lacks a mechanism to prevent users from selecting time-consuming attractions that might be challenging to insert without modification.
    - *Why:* Implementing an error prevention feature would assist users in making more informed choices, avoiding the selection of attractions that could disrupt the scheduling process.
    - *Severity:* 2

17. **H3: User control and freedom**
    - *Where:* Plan your next trip - How much do you plan to spend on this trip.
    - *What:* The platform restricts budget adjustments to only increasing or decreasing 1 euro by 1 and lacking the option for specifying non-round numbers.
    - *Why:* Optimal user experience would involve allowing users to input their exact budget directly, avoiding inconvenience for those with specific, precise budget requirements.
    - *Severity:* 1

18. **H3: User control and freedom**
    - *Where:* Plan your next trip - Add attraction
    - *What:* When selecting the hour, the platform offers only half-hour time ranges.
    - *Why:* Users may prefer a more precise time selection to adhere to a strict timetable.
    - *Severity:* 1

19. **H6: Recognition rather than recall**
    - *Where:* Trip Overview - Add Attraction
    - *What:* The system showcases a list of the most viewed attractions based on the city and user input for preferred activities during the attraction addition process, demonstrating a commendable application of "recognition rather than recall”.
    - *Why:* This feature simplifies the user experience by presenting familiar options, derived from popular searches, eliminating the need for users to recall specific attractions.
    - *Severity:* 1

20. **H10: Help and documentation**
    - *Where:* Trip overview
    - *What:* The absence of direct links to websites for purchasing tickets is a missed opportunity for user convenience.
    - *Why:* Integrating direct links to ticket purchase websites in the trip overview would enhance user convenience by providing quick access to relevant information.
    - *Severity:* 1

21. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
    - *Where:* Trip overview - Add attraction
    - *What:* The design is not clear, it is a textbox but with the icon of a sliding window (v)
    - *Why:* It seems that you can select something from a list but actually you have to write something beforehand. So, default options may speed-up the process
    - *Severity:* 1

22. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* Trip overview
    - *What:* The status bar is no longer present
    - *Why:* If it doesn’t affect the visibility of the whole page it could be great to keep the status bar
    - *Severity:* 1


### Prototype 2 - Mobile

1. **H3 User Control and Freedom**
   - *Where:* Sub-plan section
   - *What:* Sub-plans are currently not editable.
   - *Why:* Limits user control and ability to modify or correct plans.
   - *Severity:* 3 

2. **H2 Match Between System and the Real World**
   - *Where:* Main interface
   - *What:* Lack of a menu bar on the page.
   - *Why:* Inconsistent with standard interface conventions, potentially confusing users.
   - *Severity:* 3 

3. **H2 Match Between System and the Real World**
   - *Where:* General navigation
   - *What:* No home button designed.
   - *Why:* Defies common navigation conventions, hindering user orientation.
   - *Severity:* 3

4. **H1 Visibility of System Status**
   - *Where:* Error handling
   - *What:* No pop-up designed for errors.
   - *Why:* Fails to provide immediate feedback on errors, leaving users uncertain.
   - *Severity:* 4

5. **H5 Error Prevention**
   - *Where:* Plan creation
   - *What:* No offers for tickets to tourist places or eateries.
   - *Why:* Misses an opportunity to prevent user disappointment and enhance experience.
   - *Severity:* 2

6. **H3 User Control and Freedom**
   - *Where:* Plan management
   - *What:* No delete button to completely remove a plan.
   - *Why:* Limits user control over managing their plans.
   - *Severity:* 3

7. **H1 Visibility of System Status**
   - *Where:* Saving process
   - *What:* No pop-up message to confirm saving.
   - *Why:* Lacks clear feedback on action completion, leading to uncertainty.
   - *Severity:* 2 

8. **H2 Match Between System and the Real World**
   - *Where:* App initialization
   - *What:* Absence of a language selection button on the first page.
   - *Why:* Does not cater to a diverse user base, hindering accessibility.
   - *Severity:* 3

9. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
   - *Where:* On the page to list created trips
   - *What:* There is no button to easily access the page to create a new trip
   - *Why:* This is not efficient because if the user sees from the list that a trip is missing, he has to go back to the home page to click on the button to add a new trip, whereas a simple button on the list could save him time and make the application more efficient.
   - *Severity:* 2

10. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* On the page to list created trips
    - *What:* The terminology used is different from the button used to access the page
    - *Why:* A difference in terminology can disrupt the user's browsing experience, telling him he's clicked in the wrong place. If the button is labeled "trip", the page should display "trips" and not "itineraries".
    - *Severity:* 1

11. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* Page to list created trips + page to create a new trip
    - *What:* The initial navigation bar disappears when you select an option on it
    - *Why:* In my experience, the navigation bar should be visible on all pages linked to a navigation element. For example, the bar should always be present on the trip list page and the trip creation page, since these pages can only be accessed from this navigation menu.
    - *Severity:* 1

12. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* Page to personalize the trip by voice
    - *What:* There is no indication that we should firstly click on “stop” before clicking on “restart” or “confirm”
    - *Why:* If the buttons are present but not clickable, a visual element should indicate that we can’t use it right now with a possible indication of the reason. Aucune indication qu’il faut cliquer sur le carré avant de cliquer sur le reset
    - *Severity:* 2

13. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* On the full form to create a new trip
    - *What:* The button on the navigation bar indicates that we will create a “NEW” trip but once we are on the page it says “NEXT” trip.
    - *Why:* A difference in terminology can disrupt the user's browsing experience, telling him he's clicked in the wrong place.
    - *Severity:* 1

14. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* On the page to select the city of the trip
    - *What:* The display of the input can be misleading
    - *Why:* The input is a text input where certain options are displayed according to the text entered (for example, if you press "R", you'll see "Ravenna", "Rimini" and "Roma" as options), while the icon suggests to the user that it's a drop-down list
    - *Severity:* 3

15. **H3: User control and freedom**
    - *Where:* On the page to plan the trip using the voice and more specifically the help pop-up
    - *What:* There is no visual indication on how to close the help pop-up
    - *Why:* The user should always be able to see quickly how to exit the current interaction
    - *Severity:* 3
 
16. **H1: Visibility of system status**
    - *Where:* On the page to plan the trip using the voice
    - *What:* While you're recording, there's no indication of what the system understands.
    - *Why:* If the trip is very long, the explanation can take some time and, as a result, errors on the part of the user or what the system understands can occur very often. Having visual information about what the system understands can help users to realize the error not at the end, but while they're talking.
    - *Severity:* 3

17. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* On the form to create a new trip
    - *What:* There are 3 steps, and there are 3 different buttons (label + design) to go to the next step
    - *Why:* It's important to maintain design consistency when we're working on the same functionality. So, in my opinion, having the same button to go from step 1 to 2 and from step 2 to 3 can be interesting. What's more, the button to validate the trip should also be similar or very different (not the same action).
    - *Severity:* 3

18. **H5: Error prevention**
    - *Where:* On the last page of the form to create a new trip
    - *What:* How to change the city isn’t clear while how to change the date is very clear
    - *Why:* A user who selects the wrong city and, as a result, obtains the wrong trip risks losing out on changing the city. They will click on the edit icon, but will only be able to change the date, not the city. Consistency in the editing behavior of these two elements (back to step 1) may be useful to avoid confusion.
    - *Severity:* 3

19. **H4: Consistency and standards**
    - *Where:* On the form to create a new trip
    - *What:* The behavior of the “Go back” button is misleading
    - *Why:* On the first step, the go back leaves the form but then, on the other pages, it allows going back to the previous step. But the end of the form, where you can edit the information entered at step 1, lets the user think that you can’t go back between steps. At the same time, what happens to the data? Is it retained? Deleted? Is there an error or a message to warn of the impact?
    - *Severity:* 4

20. **H5: Error prevention**
    - *Where:* On the form to create a new trip where you can edit the date after indicating all the steps by voice
    - *What:* No prevention against the loss of information for deleted dates
    - *Why:* Changing the date from "12-20-2023 to 12-27-2023" to "12-20-2023 to 12-25-2023" does not result in any prevention by means of a message or other means, whereas you lose the information relating to the 26th and 27th (deleted days).
    - *Severity:* 3

21. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
    - *Where:* On the pop-up to show the itinerary trip of the day
    - *What:* The map doesn’t give more information than the list and should display the path between steps
    - *Why:* In my opinion, the use of a map is more to know the path between steps instead of simply showing the location of each step.
    - *Severity:* 2

22. **H9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
    - *Where:* On the form to create a new trip where you can edit the date after indicating all the steps by voice
    - *What:* There is no way to undo a change at the end of the form
    - *Why:* Changing the date from "20-12-2023 to 27-12-2023" to "20-12-2023 to 25-12-2023" will result in the loss of data for the 26th and 27th, but if this is an error, you won't be able to undo the action. At the same time, if you use the "modify" function to delete a step from a defined day, you may encounter the same problems where several steps are deleted, but you can't undo the action.
    - *Severity:* 3

23. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
    - *Where:* On the page to select the city of the trip
    - *What:* There is no indication of the country where the city is
    - *Why:* If two cities have the same name in different countries, this may cause confusion for the user looking for the city in question, so displaying the country associated with the city may make the search easier. However, if the application is for Italy only, this information should be displayed somewhere else, if not next to the city.
    - *Severity:* 2
    
## Chosen prototype
We opted to proceed with the **desktop prototype** for our app instead of the mobile version due to several strategic considerations. The desktop environment offers a larger canvas that allows for more expansive and detailed user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, certain features and functionalities, such as the map visualization, are better suited for desktop interactions, providing users with a more robust and immersive interaction. Moreover, considering the nature of our app and the three tasks we selected, the desktop platform aligns well with the complexity and depth of our content, ensuring optimal usability and efficiency.

### Heuristic violations we didn't consider

5. **H4: Consistency and standards** (Lack of home button)
   - We discarded this violation since in every page, as standard behaviour, by clicking the URBANHUB logo, the user is redirected to the homepage. So also the plan next trip page has this functionality. Every page has also a back button to come back to the previous page

12. **H3: User control and freedom** (Lack of Cancel button in the trip creation)
   - We actually have multiple ways, even not explicitly labeling it, to cancel and exit from the trip creation. The user can both click multiple times on the back arrows until he reaches the homepage, or directly he can click on the URBANHUB logo to reach the homepage. We didn't create a specific cancel button since in our app, the key concept is to create a trip, so a user can go back and forth between pages to modify and change data but deciding to leave the creation of a trip is an unusual action, even if it is possible in several ways

13. **H3: User control and freedom** (Bad question in preferences page)
   - We agree with this violation but it was just an example of question in the preferences page, so, surely in the actual webapp, question will be generated by AI

15. **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use** (Presenting all questions together)
   - This violation would be correct if the size of the questions set was fixed but in our webapp, questions are automatically generated by AI based on previous questions and answers, in an infinite loop. When the user thinks that he is satisfied, he can go on (even without any answer). So it would be impossible to show at the beginning all the questions

19. **H6: Recognition rather than recall** (Giving attractions suggestions when adding a new attraction)
   - We already have this feature, so, no need to implement it

20. **H10: Help and documentation** (Lack of attractions websites links)
   - We think it is a good improvement for the webapp which can add a useful feature but we believe that it is not a violation of any type. It doesn't affect the user experience


## Figma link to the mid-fi project
https://www.figma.com/file/pkAuoyPOHI3BHn0qWmBATN/Urban-Hub-medium-fidelity-prototype?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=yQORzHHWI8meKvdU-0

## Plan for the hi-fi prototype

1 - **H2: Match between system and the real world**
   - Rename the action button from "Don’t Delete" to a more intuitive "Cancel" to align with users' expectations and promote straightforward understanding. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

2 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
   - Ensure that clicking on previous trips within the "My Trips" section leads to a view-only mode, adhering to established design standards and preventing unintended consequences. Then the user can click on a button which will open the edit version of the same page.

3 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
  - We will replace the home button with the arrow back button to be consistent.

4 - **H3: User control and freedom**
  - We will include, in the trip settings page, an option to adjust the number of children (0-17 y/o), to address the needs of families and provide comprehensive user control.

6 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
  - Adjust the placement of the delete icon on the right of the component. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

7 - **H1: Visibility of system status**
  - Implement a visual message display indicating that the attraction has been added, accompanied by an updated view of the trip overview for immediate user feedback. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

8 - **H1: Visibility of system status**
  - Display a visual message confirming the successful deletion of a trip when the user clicks on Delete, providing clear system status feedback.(Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

9 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
  - Adjust the placement of the + and - buttons to align with conventional user expectations, ensuring consistency in design elements. We will use a predefined component.

10 - **H1: Visibility of system status**
  - We will modify the send button to contain a message indicating that the message has been correctly received by the bot. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

11 - **H2: Match between system and the real world**
  - Change the heading to "Plan your trip" to accurately reflect that the user is planning the current trip, not the next one.

14 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
  - We will swap the 'Save' and 'Cancel' button in the deletion popup. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

16 - **H5: Error prevention**
  - We will display the typical time expense for the selected attraction but we cannot force the user to spend all the time in that attraction. So maybe he can plan to see the attraction at strange time slots.

17 - **H3: User control and freedom**
  - We will use a component which has the possibility to handle float numbers.

18 - **H3: User control and freedom**
  - We will use predefined components to select the time. They will have the possibility to handle specific, not rounded, time slots.

21 - **H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
  - Redesign the textbox and icon to improve clarity, ensuring users understand that they need to write something beforehand and providing default options to expedite the process. (Already visible in medium fidelity prototype)

22 - **H4: Consistency and standards**
  - We will keep the status bar if the preceding page was the preferences one and we will remove it if the user came from my trips page.
